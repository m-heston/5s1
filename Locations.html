The idea of building a tower in name of Mrs. Stanton was first expressed in a letter from Professor E. W. Stanton to the Board of Trustees. The construction began in July of 1897 and the tower was completed in October of 1898. There were originally ten bells placed in the tower in 1899. Later, in 1929, twenty-six additional bells were placed in the tower, giving the campanile a total of thirty-six carillon. In 1956 another thirteen bells were placed in the tower and a final one placed in 1967, giving the campanile a total of fifty bells.</h3>
